# ComposeLoadingDialog

This is a small collection for 3 different Loading-Dialogs.
Especially the KittLoadingDialog is my personal favorit and ready-to-use.
I use this Dialogs in all my projects. As a Knight Rider fan, I love the Kitt running light!

The class LoadingDialog provides a ready to use Dialog for KITT (default), CIRCLE and LINE. If you want to change some things to the
Kitt-loading-light, you can directly
change some parameteres in KittLoadingDialog.

Use the LoadingDialogWithProgress composable to display a progress as circle or line.

It's now on Jitpack!
In settings.gradle, add maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
In your build.gradle add implementation 'com.github.nexus421:ComposeLoadingDialog:2.0.0'

Enjoy and do whatever you want to do with this small and simple Dialogs!
